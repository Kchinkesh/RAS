<p>Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians
and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.</p>

<p>Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by 
mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions
 about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of 
 the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist. The research 
 required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.</p>

<p>Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932),
 David Hilbert (1862-1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing 
 truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance,
  when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has 
  continued to the present day.</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in 
which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which 
means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth." Carl Friedrich Gauss 
(1777-1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences". Benjamin Peirce (1809-1880) called mathematics "the science that draws 
necessary conclusions". David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like
 a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only 
 be so and by no means otherwise." Albert Einstein (1879-1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;
  and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."</p>

<p>Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance and the social sciences. Applied mathematics
 has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics 
 for its own sake, without having any application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications 
 for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.</p>
